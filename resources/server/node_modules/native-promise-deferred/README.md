## Install
Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

```
$ npm install native-promise-deferred --save
```

or install using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)

```
$ yarn add native-promise-deferred
```

## Usage
> For more use-cases see the [tests](test.js)

```js
const Promise = require('native-promise-deferred')

const promise = new Promise()
promise.then((res) => console.log(res))
promise.resolve(123) // same as Promise.resolve(123)
```

## API

### [Deferred](index.js#L52)
> Acts and works like a `Promise` constructor, but instead of accepting `resolver` function like `function (resolve, reject) {}` it accepts an `options` optional object that is allows you to pass custom Promise constructor for `options.Promise` when there's no support for native promise in the used environment.

**Params**

* `options` **{Object}**: directly passed to [native-or-another][]'s "register"    
* `options.global` **{Boolean}**: pass `false` to disable registering it as `global.Promise`    
* `returns` **{Promise}**: a standard Promise object with `.resolve` and `.reject` methods  

**Example**

```js
const Deferred = require('native-promise-deferred')

const promise = new Deferred()

promise.then((res) => {
  console.log('result:', res) // => 123
})
promise.resolve(123)

// or passing custom promise
// for nodejs < v0.12 where no native promise support

const Bluebird = require('bluebird')
const customPromise = new Deferred({ Promise: Bluebird })

customPromise.catch((er) => console.log('ERR!', er))
// => ERR! Error: foo bar

customPromise.reject(new Error('foo bar'))
```

## Contributing
Pull requests and stars are always welcome. For bugs and feature requests, [please create an issue][open-issue-url].  
Please read the [contributing guidelines][contributing-url] for advice on opening issues, pull requests, and coding standards.  
If you need some help and can spent some cash, feel free to [contact me at CodeMentor.io][codementor-url] too.

**In short:** If you want to contribute to that project, please follow these things

1. Please DO NOT edit [README.md](README.md), [CHANGELOG.md][changelogmd-url] and [.verb.md](.verb.md) files. See ["Building docs"](#building-docs) section.
2. Ensure anything is okey by installing the dependencies and run the tests. See ["Running tests"](#running-tests) section.
3. Always use `npm run commit` to commit changes instead of `git commit`, because it is interactive and user-friendly. It uses [commitizen][] behind the scenes, which follows Conventional Changelog idealogy.
4. Do NOT bump the version in package.json. For that we use `npm run release`, which is [standard-version][] and follows Conventional Changelog idealogy.

Thanks a lot! :)

## Building docs
Documentation and that readme is generated using [verb-generate-readme][], which is a [verb][] generator, so you need to install both of them and then run `verb` command like that

```
$ npm install verbose/verb#dev verb-generate-readme --global && verb
```

_Please don't edit the README directly. Any changes to the readme must be made in [.verb.md](.verb.md)._

## Running tests
Clone repository and run the following in that cloned directory

```
$ npm install && npm test
```
